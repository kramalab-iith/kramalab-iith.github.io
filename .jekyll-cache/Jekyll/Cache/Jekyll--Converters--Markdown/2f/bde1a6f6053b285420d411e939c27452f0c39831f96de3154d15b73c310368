The <a href="/">‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ (Krama) Lab</a> is a research group steered by the research interests of <a href="https://mkaul.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Manohar Kaul</a>. Our research projects primarily focus on <b>applied algebraic topology</b> (topological data analysis), <b>optimal transport theory</b> (discrete OT and assignment / matching problems), and 
<b>geometric deep learning</b> (graph and point-cloud representation learning, knowledge graph representations). The work aims to propose machine learning algorithms that are both practical and theoretically well-founded. An overarching principle underlying most of our lab's research is to produce efficient learning algorithms that exploit the geometric and/or topological information
present in data, which can manifest itself as latent higher-order structures, to perform well on limited training examples.

Our work has resulted in publications in top-tier venues for <b>machine learning</b> (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR), <b>NLP</b> (e.g., ACL) and <b>computer vision</b> (e.g., ECCV). For more detailed information on our publications, please visit our <a href="/publications">publications</a> page. We are actively involved in training new students on our research topics via formal courses (e.g., CS5710 Computational Topology) and informal research brainstorming sessions.
