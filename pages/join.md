<h3>General Information:</h3>
<p>We are looking for students to assist with various research projects related to machine learning, namely on topics related to topological data analysis (TDA), optimal transport (discrete problems), combinatorial optimization, and geometric deep learning (graph representation learning and work with point clouds), to name a few. 
</p>
<p>Interested students must have a background in computer science and/or mathematics and knowledge of at least one of the following programming languages: Python, C++, R, and MATLAB. I am also open to co-supervise mathematics students who are seeking to apply mathematics to machine learning and data science in general.
