Drs Griffith guest lecture regularly for a number of traditional courses at Washington University School of Medicine. Drs Griffith also coordinate the Cancer Informatics Journal Club and Dr Obi Griffith is course master for a Genomics in Medicine course. The Griffith Lab is deeply committed to providing open source educational resources to aid the bioinformatics community. To this end we maintain several online courses and tutorials. We also deliver periodic workshops based on these materials (see below). To date we have led 23 workshops held in 7 cities and 4 countries. Furthermore, we and many members of the lab are actively engaged in community forums such as [BioStars](https://www.biostars.org/).

### Upcoming Workshops
1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory - [Advanced Sequencing Technologies & Bioinformatics Analysis, Virtual, November 16-20, 2020](https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-SEQTEC&year=20)


### Past Workshops
The following are hosted in different locations and times every year or two. Registration and other details of each course can be found on the website of each course organizer (linked below).
1. RNA-seq analysis and cloud computing ([CBW](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/), Toronto)
2. Advanced Sequencing Technologies and Applications ([CSHL](https://meetings.cshl.edu/courseshome.aspx), New York)
3. Genomic Data Visualization/Interpretation ([Physalia Courses](https://www.physalia-courses.org/), Berlin)
4. Precision Medicine Bioinformatics ([PR Informatics](https://www.prinformatics.com/), Glasgow)
5. High-Throughput Biology: From Sequence to Networks ([CSHL](https://meetings.cshl.edu/courseshome.aspx) / [CBW](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/), New York)
6. Workshop on Genomics ([Evomics](http://evomics.org/workshops/), Český Krumlov)

### Online Courses
1. [rnabio.org](http://rnabio.org) - Informatics for RNA-seq: A web resource for analysis on the cloud. <br> Educational tutorials and working pipelines for RNA-seq analysis including an introduction to: cloud computing, critical file formats, reference genomes, gene annotation, expression, differential expression, alternative splicing, data visualization, and interpretation.
2. [genviz.org](http://genviz.org/) - Genomic Data Visualization and Interpretation. <br> In-depth tutorials for the interpretation and visualization of omic data including: genome browsing and interpretation, introduction to BioMart, liftover, ProteinPaint, COSMIC, introduction to R, ggplot2, R Markdown, Shiny, GenVisR, differential expression and pathway analysis, variant annotation and interpretation, and others.
3. [pmbio.org](http://pmbio.org/) - Precision Medicine Bioinformatics. <br>An end-to-end precision medicine analysis of real human genome (WGS and Exome) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) data for a hypothetical patient. The goal of the analysis is to identify personalized therapeutic options for this patient as well as identifying any prognostic or diagnostic implications in the data.
