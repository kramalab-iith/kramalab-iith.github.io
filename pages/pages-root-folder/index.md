layout: frontpage_new

#
# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
#
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this
# url: /getting-started/
#
# To style the button in different colors, use no value
# to use the main color or success, alert or secondary.
# To change colors see sass/_01_settings_colors.scss

<p>The <a href="/about_name">क्रम (Krama)</a> Lab is a Geometric Deep Learning and Graph Neural Networks Lab run by <a href="https://subodh01006.github.io" target="_blank">Dr Manohar Kaul</a> with a focus on researching on geometric machine learning (graph and point-cloud representation learning), optimal transport (discrete OT and assignment problems) and applied algebraic topology (topological data analysis). The work involves developing practical machine learning algorithms with rigorous theoretical foundations.
</p>
<p>We are affiliated with the <a href="http://cse.iith.ac.in" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.iith.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Hydeabad</a>. We are interested in core methodology research on, among others, learning with limited training data (few shot learning), as well as applications of graphs/manifold data in field of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Transfer Learning and Explainable AI.
